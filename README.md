### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2020

+ Projec title: Death Penalty and Gun Control
+ This project is conducted by [Yiran Lin]

+ Project summary: Death penalty and gun control have always been politicized during election seasons. It would be interesting to shift attention away from the politicians and investigate voters' thoughts. In this project, I will to explore and answer the following questions:
- Over the years, did voters' attitude alter? 
- Is there a connection between voters' party identification and attitude toward these two topics?
- Would being Conservative or Liberal affect voters' attitude toward these two topics?
